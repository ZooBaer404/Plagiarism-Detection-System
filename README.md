# Plagiarism Detection System

Plagiarism Detection System (PDS) is an online system built to check students' research project for plagiarized content. Designed specifically for academic institutions who have their own custom repositories. PDS can show which source or research paper it has matched and up to what percent, which we will refer to as source mapping. PDS can show live progress while checking students' research. PDS is the full solution. Academic institutions can upload their repositories and check against them.

## How to Access

Use a web browser to use PDS.
