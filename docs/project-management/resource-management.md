# Resource Management Plan

This file documents how **people**, **tools**, and **time** will be allocated effectively — ensuring no one is overworked, underused, or somehow debugging in a production server at 2am.

## Human Resource Allocation

## Resource Contingency Plan

> If someone gets sick, goes rogue, or a server explodes, here’s how we bounce back.

- Maintain at least **1 backup** per key resource
- Cross-train Devs and QA in minimal tasks
- Pre-allocate **buffer time** in critical sprints
- Maintain a pool of **freelancers** or interns (if budget allows)

## Historical Resource Adjustments

| Date             | Change Made                       | Reason                        | Impact                   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
